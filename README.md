## Tips
 -My firmware has added dynamic overclocking. Whether it is hot or not, it depends on what the background program is running.
 -If it feels very hot, add a fan. It is recommended that the fan is 6cm×6cm, thinner 1cm, USB is also OK or terminal cable zh1.5
 -Compatible with r2c devices at the same time
